# ðŸ’¬ About [Officer Mills](https://github.com/OfficerMills)

Hi! I'm Officer Mills, and I am new in the coding/development world and chose to get into the FiveM environment in particular for the love of GTA5 RP. I do currently own a FiveM server called [One World Role Play](https://discord.gg/8s7x6yakad). I  have recently started branching out into html and css due to being in the roleplay world as their is much need for UI's as well as many other things. I do not consider myself an actual "developer," maybe I could go with beginner at most.. We all start somewhere right? I do stream on Twitch and TikTok both occasionally, when I find the time. I grew up in Middle Tennesse, in the middle of nowhere TN I should say so I have spent 90% of my 36yr life on a farm, so this coding world is certainly a different change of pace for me but I am loving learning so far
